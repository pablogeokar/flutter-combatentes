# Critical Features & Fixes

This document outlines the most important features and bug fixes that are essential for the game's functionality.

## üîí Critical Bug Fixes

### Piece Visibility Logic

**Problem**: Players could see opponent piece names, breaking core game mechanics
**Solution**: Implemented robust local player identification system

- Uses player name matching to identify local vs opponent pieces
- Multiple fallback strategies for player identification
- Only shows piece names for own pieces and revealed pieces after combat
- Maintains strategic bluffing element of the game

### App Freezing on Server Unavailable

**Problem**: App would freeze completely when server was down
**Solution**: Comprehensive connection management system

- 10-second connection timeout prevents indefinite hanging
- Null-safe WebSocket channel management
- Proper async/await handling in initialization
- Graceful error handling with user feedback

### Player Name Synchronization

**Problem**: Server created players with generic names instead of user-provided names
**Solution**: Enhanced name handling system

- Server processes name updates for pending and active players
- Client sends name immediately upon connection
- Robust name matching with multiple strategies

## üöÄ Essential Features

### Connection Status System

**Implementation**: Progressive status updates

- "Connecting to server..." ‚Üí Initial connection attempt
- "Connected to server. Waiting for opponent..." ‚Üí Connection established
- "Game in progress" ‚Üí Both players connected and playing
- "Connection error" ‚Üí Server unavailable or timeout
- "Disconnected from server" ‚Üí Connection lost

### Automatic Reconnection

**Implementation**: Smart reconnection logic

- Automatic retry attempts when connection fails
- Manual "Try New Connection" button
- Preserves user data during reconnection
- Visual feedback during reconnection attempts

### User Data Persistence

**Implementation**: File-based local storage

- Saves player names between app sessions
- Splash screen checks for existing user data
- Smart navigation based on saved data
- User menu for managing saved data

## üõ°Ô∏è Stability Measures

### Null Safety Implementation

- All WebSocket operations use null-aware operators
- Comprehensive null checks before accessing objects
- Safe disposal of resources and controllers
- Fallback values for all nullable fields

### Error Boundary System

- Try-catch blocks around all critical operations
- User-friendly error messages instead of technical exceptions
- Graceful degradation when features fail
- Logging for debugging without exposing internals

### Resource Management

- Proper disposal of StreamControllers
- Timer cancellation to prevent memory leaks
- WebSocket connection cleanup
- State reset during reconnection attempts

## üéØ User Experience Priorities

### Immediate Feedback

- Loading indicators during connection attempts
- Progress messages showing current status
- Error dialogs with clear next steps
- Success confirmations for user actions

### Intuitive Navigation

- Splash screen automatically routes based on saved data
- Menu options clearly labeled and accessible
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Consistent visual design throughout app

### Robust Multiplayer

- Real-time synchronization between players
- Authoritative server prevents cheating
- Graceful handling of player disconnections
- Clear indication of whose turn it is

## üîß Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features

1. Always implement null safety from the start
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Provide user feedback for all operations
4. Test with server unavailable scenarios
5. Ensure proper resource cleanup

### When Modifying Existing Code

1. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
2. Update related error handling
3. Test reconnection scenarios
4. Verify piece visibility logic still works
5. Check that user data persistence continues working

### Testing Priorities

1. Server unavailable scenarios
2. Network interruption during gameplay
3. Multiple reconnection attempts
4. Player name synchronization
5. Piece visibility for both players

These features and fixes are essential for a stable, professional gaming experience.
